          Economic hardship resulting from a depressed economy

        As an environmentally sensitive company, our policy is to prevent any
        disturbances and instead foster active cooperation with host
        communities. We aim to achieve this through our HSES department by:

          Engaging host community indigenes for all casual employment and site

          Allocating a budget for community development projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p className="hses-intro">
        Our HSES department will work closely with our clientâ€™s Community
        Liaison Officers (CLOs) and visit anticipated host communities to
        establish agreements that outline areas of cooperation and assistance.
        These agreements will be in line with company procedures and will be
        finalized before mobilization to project sites.
      </p>

      <p className="hses-intro">
        Additionally, our goal is to avoid disturbances or minimize them
        entirely. To achieve this, we will ensure representation in all
        community affairs, seminars, and meetings organized by our clients.
      </p>

      <p className="hses-intro">
        We will respond to all formal community requests in an appropriate and
        timely manner. In the event of disturbances, we will strive to resolve
        conflicts peacefully using our previously established relationships with
        the communities involved.
      </p>

      <p className="hses-intro">
        If conflicts escalate beyond our control, we will seek the support of
        Local Government Authorities, clan heads, and elite members of the
        communities for resolution.
